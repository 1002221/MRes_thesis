soln_1D and soln_2D solve the equation in 1D and 2D.

testingN checks, for all other parameters given, how increasing or decreasing the cutoff affects the solution.

exact solution computes the exact solution to the ODE u' = 1-u^3.

estimatingerror2D is used to show that convergence doesn't take place in 2D.

All other functions are called (either directly, or indirectly) by soln_1D and soln_2D.
